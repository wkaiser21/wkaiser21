## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Wyatt, a recent computer science graduate from Drexel University.  
I'm primarily interested in web and mobile app development and currently working on expanding my cloud computing knowledge.
I've worked professionally as a web developer for a co-op at Drexel University College of Medicine and have personal project experience with both building websites and mobile applications.

I'm also passionate about ideas of human-centered design and good user experiences.

Feel free to connect!
